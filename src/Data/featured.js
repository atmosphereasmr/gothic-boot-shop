The early days of Marilyn Manson (And The Spooky Kids) were full of color, decadence and freakishly outlandish stage antics that we will never see again! Marilyn Manson himself noted that the band’s evolution from Portrait and Smells Like Children to Antichrist Superstar was a change from a punk-rock driven, cartoonish image to a darker sound and a much more serious image. Regardless, the Portrait of an American Family (also known as the Spooky Kids era) showcases the very exciting rise of the Antichrist Superstar from cross-dressing, striped-socks dawned freak show to the Antichrist Superstar himself. Features the band’s earliest hit songs “Lunchbox” “Get Your Gun” and “Cake and Sodomy.”\t","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/519Og1HbbbL.jpg","$369.00","http://amzn.to/2FvbLYw","Also comes with the rare Portrait of an American Family shirt."],["5","Antichrist Superstar Socks","The time has come, it is quite clear.
